# Atta Page
In the begining of my coding bootcamp. I studied about using Bootstrap as css framework in the class. And then i got a homework to create a page using Bootstrap. I made a page about Atta profile. I learn how to make a navbar, grid system, I used jumbotron, container and card too. So this is my 1st exercise to learn Bootstrap.
